# Building a vector data cube: North Carolina SIDS

This is a port of the classic North Carolina sudden-infant-death-syndrome (SIDS)
example used to introduce vector data cubes in both the R `stars` package
(https://r-spatial.org/r/2022/09/12/vdc.html) and Python's `xvec`
(https://xvec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html).

The dataset is a set of 100 county polygons with birth and SIDS counts for two
periods (1974 and 1979). Instead of keeping these as columns of a flat table,
we arrange them as a *vector data cube*: a `DimStack` whose first dimension is
indexed by the county geometries themselves (via [`GeometryLookup`](@ref)), and
whose second dimension is the year.

The data ships with R's `sf` package; we download the shapefile straight from
its GitHub repository (~150 kB).

counties = GeoDataFrames.read(datadir("nc.shp"))

## Constructing the cube

The geometry dimension is a `Geometry` dimension wrapping a `GeometryLookup` of
the county polygons. The lookup builds a spatial tree over the geometries, so
spatial selectors on the cube are fast, and it carries the CRS (the data is in
NAD27, EPSG:4267).
=#

geoms = GO.get_geometries(counties)
gl = GeometryLookup(counties)
# You could also write `gl = GeometryLookup(GO.get_geometries(counties); crs=GI.crs(counties))` if you want to do this manually.

# Let's now create a time dimension, called `Year`.
years = Dim{:Year}([1974, 1979])
# Finally, we can construct a DimStack with the data, which is a set of dimensional arrays
# which share some common axes.
cube = DimStack((;
    births = DimArray([counties.BIR74 counties.BIR79], (Geometry(gl), years)),
    sids = DimArray([counties.SID74 counties.SID79], (Geometry(gl), years)),
    nonwhite_births = DimArray([counties.NWBIR74 counties.NWBIR79], (Geometry(gl), years)),
))

#=
## Spatial selectors

The cube is indexed by real geometries, so we can ask spatial questions
directly. Which county contains Raleigh?
=#

raleigh = (-78.6382, 35.7796)
wake = cube[Geometry(Contains(raleigh))]
# This returns a DimStack that has certain elements.  We can select a layer of the stack:
wake.births
# and check it has the correct things:
size(wake[:births]) == (1, 2)

# The selector machinery also works on the lookup itself, which lets us recover
# the county's attributes from the original table:
wake_idx = only(Lookups.selectindices(gl, Contains(raleigh)))
println("Raleigh is in $(counties.NAME[wake_idx]) county")

#=
## Derived layers

Cube arithmetic works as usual — dimensions (including the geometry lookup) are
carried through broadcasting. Here is the SIDS rate per 1000 births:
=#

rate = @d cube.sids ./ cube.births .* 1000 name=:rate

worst_rate, worst_idx = findmax(rate[Year=At(1974)])

#=
## To a table

You can call any Tables.jl compatible constructor, in this case `DataFrame`, on the cube to get a table.
=#

tbl = DataFrame(rate)
# We can sort the table by the value, and get the top 5 counties by rate:
first(sort(tbl, :rate; rev=true), 5)
# and write it to a shapefile:
GeoDataFrames.write(GeoDataFrames.ArchGDALDriver(), datadir("nc_rates.shp"), tbl; geometrycolumn = :Geometry)
