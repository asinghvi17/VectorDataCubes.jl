# Zonal statistics over countries: NCEP air temperature

This is a port of xvec's "Zonal statistics" tutorial
(https://xvec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/zonal_stats.html) and of the R `stars`
`aggregate(raster, by = polygons)` example
(https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/): aggregate a gridded temperature time
series over country polygons, producing a vector data cube over
`(Ti, Geometry)`.

Data:
- `air_temperature.nc` — xarray's tutorial dataset (NCEP reanalysis 2m air
  temperature over North America, 6-hourly 2013–2014, ~7 MB NetCDF), fetched
  from the `pydata/xarray-data` repository.
- Country polygons from Natural Earth (1:110m admin-0), via NaturalEarth.jl.

## The raster cube

The NetCDF stores temperature in Kelvin on 0–360° longitudes; we shift the
longitudes to the -180–180° convention Natural Earth uses, and convert to °C.
Then we reduce the 6-hourly series to a per-cell monthly climatology with
`groupby`/`combine`, leaving a `(X, Y, Ti)` cube with 12 time steps.
=#

air = RasterStack(airfile)[:air]
## Shift with a range (not a plain vector) so the lookup keeps its regular
## step — Rasters' masking machinery requires a regular grid.
xs = DD.lookup(air, X)
air = set(air, X => range(first(xs) - 360, last(xs) - 360; length=length(xs)))
air = air .- 273.15

monthly = DD.combine(mean, groupby(air, Ti => month); dims=Ti)

## The geometry dimension: countries as a vector data cube

Natural Earth returns a GeoJSON FeatureCollection. `vectordatacube` lifts it
into a `DimStack` over a `Geometry` dimension: the country polygons become a
`GeometryLookup`, and the attribute columns become layers over it. Attributes
and geometries are now one object, so subsetting the cube keeps them aligned —
no separate table to keep in row sync. We keep three attribute layers and
select the North American countries.
=#

countries = vectordatacube(
    naturalearth("admin_0_countries", 110);
    layers=(:NAME, :CONTINENT, :POP_EST), crs=EPSG(4326),
)
northam = countries[Geometry=findall(==("North America"), countries[:CONTINENT])]
geodim = DD.dims(northam, Geometry)

#=
## Zonal aggregation -> vector data cube

Passing the geometry dimension (or its lookup) as `of` makes `zonal` return a
cube over `(Ti, Geometry)` instead of a plain vector: the mean is computed per
country *per month* (each spatial slice separately), and the result keeps the
geometry lookup, so spatial selectors keep working on it.

Two coverage caveats, handled by keywords:
- values are means over the raster's coverage (lon 160°W–30°W,
  lat 15°N–75°N) — countries partly outside that window are averaged over
  the overlapping part only;
- at 2.5° resolution, island nations smaller than a grid cell can cover *no*
  cell centers at all. `emptyval = missing` makes those come back as
  `missing` instead of `mean` of an empty slice (which would be `NaN`).
=#

temps = zonal(mean, monthly; of=geodim, emptyval=missing, progress=false)
size(temps) == (12, length(geodim))

# Seasonal cycle of the country containing a point in the US Great Plains:
usa = temps[Geometry(Contains((-100.0, 40.0)))]
round.(vec(parent(usa)); digits=1)

#=
Countries entirely outside the raster's coverage (here, those fully south of
15°N like Panama and Costa Rica) come back as `missing`, so reductions over
the geometry axis should `skipmissing`. Which country is warmest in July, and
coldest in January? `temps` and `northam[:NAME]` share the geometry dimension,
so indexing one with positions found in the other is always in sync.
=#
july = temps[Ti=At(7)]
january = temps[Ti=At(1)]
println("warmest in July:    ", northam[:NAME][argmax(skipmissing(parent(july)))])
println("coldest in January: ", northam[:NAME][argmin(skipmissing(parent(january)))])

#=
## Reprojection

The geometry lookup carries its CRS, so the whole cube can be reprojected;
only the geometry dimension is affected.
=#

temps_3857 = reproject(EPSG(3857), temps)
crs(DD.lookup(temps_3857, Geometry)) == EPSG(3857)

#=
## To a table

One row per (month, country); the `:Geometry` column holds the country
polygons.
=#

df = DataFrame(vectordatacubetable(temps))
july_df = dropmissing(subset(df, :Ti => ByRow(==(7))))
first(sort(july_df, :value; rev=true), 5)
